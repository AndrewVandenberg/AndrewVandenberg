- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Vandenberg; an Actuarial Sciences major at Appalachian State University.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Actuarial Science and how it intersects with Data Science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Acuarial Science through school, and how to utilize machine learning models to better predict future outcomes.
- ðŸ“« Fun fact: I love to run, and ran for App's Cross Country and Track team from 2012-2017.
