- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Vandenberg; an Actuarial Sciences major at Appalachian State University.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Actuarial Science and how it intersects with Data Science.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Acuarial Science through school, and how to utilize machine learning models to better predict future outcomes.
- ğŸ“« Fun fact: I ran Cross Country and Track at ASU, and had brain surgery in 2018.
